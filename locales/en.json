    "paragraph1": "I didn't start in tech. I started with people, processes, and the reality that emerges when a new system lands in an organization and nobody knows what to do with it. That taught me the hardest thing about technology is never the technology. It's the people who need to trust it.",
    "paragraph2": "When I built Research Translator at KU Lighthouse, the goal wasn't to impress with AI. It was to give advisors their time back. 60 minutes became 10. Not because I chose the smartest model, but because I insisted the architecture had to be so solid that nobody needed to check if the AI was wrong.",
