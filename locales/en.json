    "label": "About Me",
    "heading": "The bridge between logic and human systems",
    "paragraph1": "I didn't start in tech. I started with people, processes, and the reality that emerges when a new system lands in an organization and nobody knows what to do with it. That taught me the hardest thing about technology is never the technology. It's the people who need to trust it.",
    "paragraph2": "When I built Research Translator at KU Lighthouse, the goal wasn't to impress with AI. It was to give advisors their time back. 60 minutes became 10. Not because I chose the smartest model, but because I insisted the architecture had to be so solid that nobody needed to check if the AI was wrong.",
    "paragraph3": "Today I build AI agents. And the first thing I build is always the same: The foundation for people to actually use it.",
